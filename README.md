# Forewords
A long time ago, I solved a (tinyâ€¦) bunch of problems from the Walter Rudin's 
*Functional Analysis*.

I am carefully rewriting my solutions, aiming at the cleanest possible result.

- 1_7.tex  
  I choose to start with this because it is a lovely result, since it connects 
  a topological result (*to be metrizable or not to be*) with number theory
  (basic results about dyadic expansions).
  TODO: ? Maybe I'll add an alternative proof with the (possibly) degenerate 
  expansion.
- 1_9.tex  
  Continuousness, openness of a linear mapping: First isomorphism theorem with 
  a closed space N (not necessarily the null space!).
- 1_10.tex  
  Continuousness, openess of a linear mapping onto a finite dimensional space.
  Not trivial, since the domain may be infinite-dimensional. 
- 1_14.tex  
  Alternative ways to the define topology of the test functions space D_K, 
  in the special case K=[0, 1].
- 1_16.tex   
  This is about showing that a function test topology is independent 
  from the "supremum seminorms" we consider. It is then more than an exercise, 
  it should be regarded as a very part of the textbook (sections 1.44, 1.46).
- 1_17.tex
  Given a multi-index $\alpha$, the differential operators $D^\alpha$ is 
  continuous in the test functions space topology.
