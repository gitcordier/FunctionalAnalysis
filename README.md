# Forewords
A long time ago, I solved a (tinyâ€¦) bunch of problems from the Walter Rudin's 
*Functional Analysis*.

I am carefully rewriting my solutions, aiming at the cleanest possible result.

  I choose to start with this 
  because it is a lovely result, since it connects a topological result 
  (*to be metrizable or not to be*) with number theory
  (basic results about dyadic expansions).
  TODO: ? Maybe I'll add an alternative proof with another expansion.
- 1_16.tex  
  This is about showing that a function test topology is independent 
  from the "supremum seminorms" we consider. It is then more than an exercise, 
  it must be considered as a part of the textbook (sections 1.44, 1.46).
