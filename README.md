# Forewords
A long time ago, I solved a (tinyâ€¦) bunch of problems from the Walter Rudin's 
*Functional Analysis*.

I am carefully rewriting my solutions, aiming at the cleanest possible result.

  Up to now, only the solution to the problem 1.7. 
  
  I choose to start with this 
  because it is a lovely result, since it connects a topological result 
  [*to be metrizable or not to be*] with number theory
  [basic results about dyadic expansions].
