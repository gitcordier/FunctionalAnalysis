\textit{In the setting of Section 1.46, prove that 
  %
    $f \mapsto D^{\alpha}f$ 
  %
is a continuous mapping of 
%
  $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ into 
  $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and also of 
  $\D_{K}$ into 
  $\D_{K}$, for every multi-index $\alpha$.
%
}
\begin{proof} 
In both cases, $D^\alpha$ is a linear mapping. 
It is then sufficient to establish continuousness at the origin.
%
We begin with the $C^\infty(\Omega)$ case. \\
\\
Let $U$ be an aribtray neighborhood of the origin.
There so exists $N$ such that $U$ contains
%
  \begin{align} 
    V_{N}= \set{
      \phi \in C^\infty(\Omega)
    }{
      \max
      \set{
        | D^\beta\phi(x) |
      }{
        | \beta | \leq N, x\in K_N
      }
    < 1/N
    }.
  \end{align}
%
Now pick $g$ in $V_{N+|\alpha|}$, so that
%
  \begin{align}
    \max
    \set{
      | D^\gamma g(x) |
    }{
      | \gamma | \leq N+| \alpha |, 
      x\in K_{N}
    }
    < \frac{1}{N}.
  \end{align}
%
(the fact that $K_N\subset K_{N+|\alpha|}$ was tacitely used).
%
The special case $\gamma = \beta + \alpha$ yields
%â€¡
\begin{align}
    \sup
    \set{
      | D^\beta D^\alpha g(x) |
    }{
      | \beta | \leq N, 
      x\in K_{N}
    }
    < \frac{1}{N}.
  \end{align}
%
We have just proved that
%
  \begin{align}
    g \in V_{N + | \alpha|}
      \then 
    D^\alpha g \in V_{N},
      \quad
      \ie
      \quad
    D^\alpha (V_{N+|\alpha|}) \subset V_N.
  \end{align}
%
The continuity of 
  $D^{\alpha}: C^\infty (\Omega) \to C^\infty (\Omega)$ 
is so established.
%%
%
We now prove the second part.
\\
%
To do so, we use the fact that 
%
  \begin{align}
    K \subset K_m \subset K_{m+1} \subset \cdots
  \end{align}
for some index $m$; see Lemma 2 of Exersice 1.16. 
A trivial consequence of this is that
  \begin{align}
    V_N = V_N \cap \D_K \quad (N \geq m).
  \end{align}
The collection $\set{V_N}{N \geq m}$ is then a local base of $\D_K$.
Finally, we reiterate the proof of the first part with $\D_K$ playing the role 
of $C^\infty(\Omega)$ and so conclude that $\D_K\to\D_K, f\mapsto D^\alpha f$ 
is continuous.
\end{proof}
