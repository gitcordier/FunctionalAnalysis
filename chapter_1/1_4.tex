\textit{Let be %
%
  $B = \{(z_{1}, z_{2}) \in \C^2: |z_{1}| \leq |z_{2}| \}$. %
%
Show that $B$ is balanced but that its interior is not.
}
%
\begin{proof}
It is obvious that the nonempty set $B$ contains the origin $(0,0)$. %
Additionally, its interior $B^\circ$ is nonempty as well. %
To see that, observe that the following set %
%
\begin{equation}
  \{(z_1, z_2) \in \C^2: |1- z_1| + |2- z_2] < 1/2 \} \subset B %
\end{equation}
%
is a neighborhood of $(1, 2) \in B$. %
Moreover, $B$ is balanced, since
\begin{equation}
  |\alpha z_1|  = |\alpha| |z_1| \leq  |\alpha| |z_2| = |\alpha z_2| %
  \qquad (|\alpha| \leq 1)
\end{equation}
%
for all $(z_1, z_2)$ in $B$. %
%
However, the nonempty set $B^\circ$ is not balanced, which we %
establish by showing that $(0, 0) \notin B^\circ$. %
%
To do so, assume, to reach a contradiction, %
that the origin has a neighborhood %
%
\begin{equation}
  U \Def \{(z_1, z_2) \in \C^2: |z_1| + |z_2] < r \} \subset B %
\end{equation}
%
for some positive $r$. Clearly, $U$ contains $(r/2, 0)$,  %
and that special case $(r/2, 0) \in B$ now contradicts the definition of $B$. %
So ends the proof.
\end{proof}
