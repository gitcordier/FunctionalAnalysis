\textit{Let be %
%
  $B = \{(z_{1}, z_{2}) \in \C^2: |z_{1}| \leq |z_{2}| \}$. %
%
Show that $B$ is balanced but that its interior is not.
}
%
\begin{proof}
It is obvious that $B$ contains the origin $(0,0)$. %
More generally, the nonempty set $B$ is balanced, since
\begin{align}
  |\alpha z_1|  = |\alpha| |z_1| \leq  |\alpha| |z_2| = |\alpha z_2| %
  \quad (|\alpha| \leq 1)
\end{align}
%
for all $(z_1, z_2)$ in $B$. %
Nevertheless, $(0, 0)$ is not an interior point of $B$. %
In order to show this, assume, to reach a contradiction, %
that the origin has a neighborhood %
%
\begin{align}
  U \triangleq \{(u_1, u_2): |u_1| + |u_2] < r \} \subset B %
\end{align}
%
for some positive $r$. Clearly, $U$ contains $(r/2, 0)$ %
and that special case $(r/2, 0) \in B$ now contradicts the definition of $B$. %
So ends the proof.
\end{proof}
